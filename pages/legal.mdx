# Privacy Policy

## Data provided by the user's browser

We do not directly record any navigation history, referral URLs, user IP addresses, User Agent
strings, or other browser information anywhere.

## MetaMask

The ExaLotto website interacts with [MetaMask][metamask], a browser extension with its own privacy
policy.

Through MetaMask our code can access the public key (also known as the _address_) of one or more
user wallets. We never associate those addresses to any PII in any way. In particular, we never
record IP addresses.

Please refer to
[Information stored in our smartcontracts](#information-stored-in-our-smartcontracts) for
information about what we store in our smartcontracts (which include wallet addresses) and how we
use it.

## Custom cookies

We store cookies in the browser to remember user preferences, such as acceptance of these legal
terms. These cookies are never stored in any server, only in the browser.

The ultimate purpose of the cookies we install is to improve the user experience. We do not intend
to profile or personally identify any user or set of users.

## Information stored in our smartcontracts

The ExaLotto website is merely a frontend for a set of [Ethereum smartcontracts][smartcontracts]. We
do not use any server environments other than those smartcontracts. Please refer to the
[whitepaper][whitepaper] for detailed information on how they work.

Whenever a user buys an ExaLotto ticket we store the following pieces of information in our
smartcontracts: ticket data (the played numbers), user wallet address, and current timestamp. This
information is publicly viewable and allows anyone to determine what numbers a wallet bought and at
what time it did. As mentioned [above](#metamask), we never associate these pieces of information to
any PII.

In addition to buying tickets, some users may want to sign up for our
[Partnership Program][partners]. In that case the user's wallet address will be recorded in several
more places throughout our smartcontracts, but still anonymously. It is possible for anyone to
determine whether a given wallet address participates in the Program by checking its EXL token
balance. The user will also earn fees as a result of participating in the Program; all earnings
associated to the user's wallet are recorded in the blockchain and publicly viewable.
