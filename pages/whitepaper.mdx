## Abstract

We hereby provide the design specification of **ExaLotto**, a lottery game based on the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (“EVM” in the following).

The game will be managed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO” in the following).

## Motivations

Lottery games have ancient origins tracing back to the Chinese Han Dynasty, between years 205 and
187 BC. The core idea of the game is that every player pays a small amount of money and a randomly
chosen lucky winner gets the money from all contributions.

Unfortunately, classic operation of such games requires a central running authority and subjects
them to serious issues:

* **Censorship**: some countries make some or all lotteries illegal.
* **Locality**: lotteries are usually State-managed and subject to local regulations, making them
  impossible to extend across borders and turn global.
* **Obscure or unfair prize allocation**: in a typical lottery game a share of the jackpot is
  assigned to every winning category, but the way these shares are calculated is almost never
  explained and is often unfair.
* **Outright scams**: classic operation provides little to no guarantees about the fairness of the
  drawing process, as well as the actual value of the ticket sales. The drawn numbers may be biased
  to favor specific players, and / or the lottery operator may advertise a jackpot that is
  significantly lower (but still attractive enough) than the ticket sales. It is certainly
  suspicious that many lotteries constantly advertise perfectly round-numbered jackpots like $1M.

Case in point, [Hot Lotto][hot-lotto] suffered one of the most famous lottery fraud scandals (not
necessarily the worst). Other known frauds include a [Serbian lottery announcing the numbers before
they were drawn][serbian-lottery] and [Chinese lottery operators reportedly stealing jackpot
money][chinese-lottery]. Other frauds that might have occurred may never be uncovered.

We want to overcome all the above problems by implementing a new lottery game based on a
decentralized, trustless, censorship-resistant, and cryptographically verified platform: the EVM.

## Game Description

For scalability reasons the game will run on the [Polygon PoS blockchain][polygon], which is
compatible with Ethereum and can run Solidity programs with little to no modifications.

Players join the game by buying one or more tickets. When buying a ticket a player chooses 6 or more
different numbers between 1 and 90 inclusive.

6 different random numbers between 1 and 90 inclusive are drawn once a week securely by the system,
and all tickets matching two or more of the drawn numbers are awarded a prize.

The prize money is managed by an Ethereum smartcontract at all times, and is kept in MATIC which is
the native currency of the Polygon PoS blockchain.

The ticket sales are also entirely managed by the smartcontract. A 6-number ticket has a small fixed
price that is the MATIC equivalent of 1.50 US dollars, recalculated at the beginning of each round
based on the latest MATIC market price. We use [ChainLink's price feeds][chainlink-price-feed] to
determine price.

Tickets with more than 6 numbers, which we call _higher order tickets_ throughout this paper, are in
every possible regard treated as if the player bought all possible 6-combinations that can be chosen
from the numbers. For example, a ticket with 8 numbers is equivalent to ${8 \choose 6} = 28$
different 6-number tickets, and in general a ticket with $k$ numbers (with $k \ge 6$) is equivalent
to ${k \choose 6}$ different 6-number tickets, with ${k \choose 6}$ being the [binomial
coefficient][binomial-coefficient] _"k choose 6"_ representing the number of ways to choose 6
elements from a set of $k$.

Given that the target price of a 6-number ticket is \$1.50, the price of a higher-order ticket with
$k$ numbers is calculated multiplying \$1.50 by the binomial coefficient $k \choose 6$. This results
in the following prices:

| Numbers in the ticket | Number of 6-combinations | Target price |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| 6                     | 1                        | $ 1.50       |
| 7                     | 7                        | $ 10.50      |
| 8                     | 28                       | $ 42.00      |
| 9                     | 84                       | $ 126.00     |
| 10                    | 210                      | $ 315.00     |
| 11                    | 462                      | $ 693.00     |
| 12                    | 924                      | $ 1,386.00   |
| 13                    | 1716                     | $ 2,574.00   |
| 14                    | 3003                     | $ 4,504.50   |
| 15                    | 5005                     | $ 7,507.50   |
| 16                    | 8008                     | $ 12,012.00  |
| 17                    | 12376                    | $ 18,564.00  |
| 18                    | 18564                    | $ 27,846.00  |
| 19                    | 27132                    | $ 40,698.00  |
| 20                    | 38760                    | $ 58,140.00  |

Five different winning categories are defined:

* tickets matching exactly 2 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 3 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 4 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 5 of the drawn numbers,
* and tickets matching all 6 drawn numbers.

ExaLotto keeps a separate prize for each category. The five prizes are funded by the revenue
generated by the ticket sales as explained in [Prize Allocation](#prize-allocation).

At the end of a round, each winning category may have zero or more winners. If there are zero
winners, as we expect to often be the case for the 6-match category, the prize of that category is
carried over to the next round; otherwise it is made available for withdrawal by the players who own
the winning tickets, and the corresponding prize of the same category in the next round starts over
from zero. An exception to this rule is the prize of the 6-match category (aka the _jackpot_), which
is treated specially as described in [Prize Allocation](#prize-allocation).

An important property is that 6-number tickets only win a prize from their highest winning category.
For example, a ticket matching 4 numbers will also match 3 numbers in several ways and 2 numbers in
several ways, but the player will only be allowed to withdraw a prize from the 4-match category.
This is not true for higher-order tickets, due to the fact that a $k$-number ticket (with $k > 6$)
is treated as $k \choose 6$ different 6-number tickets.

## DAO Management

ExaLotto is a decentralized lottery game managed by a DAO. Voting power is proportional to an
[ERC20][erc20] token with trading symbol `EXL`. The DAO is implemented using standard opensource
smartcontracts provided by [OpenZeppelin][openzeppelin]. Namely we use a
[`Governor`][openzeppelin-governor] and a [`TimelockController`][openzeppelin-timelock-controller]
with some added functionality. The `EXL` token is an [`ERC20Votes`][erc20-votes] token with some
added functionality. See the [Governance](#governance) section for an in-depth description about the
added functionality.

The `EXL` token is burnable but not mintable. The initial total supply is 1,000,000,000 `EXL` with
18 decimals, or equivalently _1e27 EXL-wei_.

The `EXL` token makes use of the regular delegation mechanism implemented by `ERC20Votes` and
commonly used in many Ethereum DAOs. In a nutshell, this mechanism requires that `EXL` holders
delegate their voting power to a specified account rather than being able to vote directly in the
DAO. A holder account can also delegate to itself and that is in fact a very common setup, but
without any delegation a holder cannot vote. Internally, the delegation mechanism enables
checkpointing of all balances, which are updated at every transfer. The checkpointing mechanism
causes transfers to consume more gas and that is why delegation and checkpointing are disabled by
default, but it is necessary because when votes are cast on a proposal the `Governor` needs to know
the voting power of each voter at a specific point in time. Keep in mind that `EXL` transfers may
happen _during_ the voting period, causing the voting power of one or more accounts to change
drastically.

The `EXL` token can optionally give its holders a claim on a share of the revenue generated by the
ticket sales, namely 10% of it. That requires delegation to be enabled for the holder account. Note
that the _delegator_ account earns said 10%, not the delegatee.

`EXL` holders who have not delegated their voting power are not entitled to receiving any revenue.
For this reason the revenue of a delegating account is calculated as a proportion of the total
delegated voting power rather than the total supply.

In some circumstances described in the following [Referral Program](#referral-program) section,
`EXL` holders may actually receive an _additional_ 10% of the ticket sale revenue.

## Referral Program

ExaLotto allows third parties known as _referrers_ to sell tickets on ExaLotto's behalf. The
incentive is that the referrer earns 10% of the revenue it generates. This referral program is
entirely managed by the lottery smartcontract.

Referrers register themselves as such on the ExaLotto website, which generates a referrer-specific
referral code and provides an HTML snippet they can embed in their website; the snippet creates an
ExaLotto widget in the page where a visitor can buy ExaLotto tickets with the referral code. At the
end of a round the referrer can withdraw the generated referral revenue.

When no referral code is used and a ticket is sold on the main ExaLotto website, the 10% share
allocated for the referrer is actually distributed pro-rated among the delegating `EXL` holders as
described in [DAO Management](#dao-management).

## Prize Allocation

As described in the [previous](#dao-management) [sections](#referral-program), 20% of the revenue
from ticket sales is distributed among partners and referrers; the remaining 80% is used to fund the
game. This 80% is divided in 6 parts: 5 to fund the prizes of each winning category and then an
extra one used to fund a stash of money that is in turn used to fund the jackpot of the next round
in case one or more players match all 6 drawn numbers; that way the jackpot is never zero. The 6
parts are divided as follows: an 18.8% is used to fund each prize and the remaining 6% is used to
fund the stash.

The entire revenue generated by the ticket sales is divided as follows:

// TODO: pie chart

Note that all 5 winning categories are allocated the same fraction of the revenue (i.e.
$80% \cdot 18.8%$) because we found this to be the fairest possible allocation. In fact, in order to
award the fairest possible prizes, the share of a given category must be inversely proportional to
the probability of winning and directly proportional to the [expected][expectation] number of
winners. In other words:

* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **higher** category because they have a
  **lower** probability of winning; and
* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **lower** category because we expect a
  **higher** number of winners.

So we have two conflicting criteria that balance each other out, as we show formally in the
following.

For a given category $k$ we can call the probability of winning in that category $p_k$, and the
expected number of winners $\xi_k$. We can use $n$ to indicate the total number of played
6-combinations in a round. $\xi_k$ is a [binomial variable][binomial-variable] with expected value
is $np_k$. Based on the two proportionality criteria above, the share of the revenue allocated to
the prize for category $k$ can be measured as:

$$
S_k = \frac{E(\xi_k)}{p_k} = \frac{np_k}{p_k} = n
$$

This measure does not depend on $p_k$ or any other $k$-dependent parameter, so **all shares must
have the same size**. This is unlike most other lotteries, which allocate seemingly arbitrary or
inadequately explained shares of the revenue to the various categories.

## Lottery Algorithm

### Scaling Problem

A lottery game is based on the core idea that a large number of players pay a small amount each, so
we need our implementation to scale to large numbers of tickets, e.g. 1 million per round or even
more.

The number of tickets matching $k$ of the drawn numbers is a [binomial variable][binomial-variable]
with [expected value][expectation] $np_k$, with $n$ being the number of tickets sold in a round and
$p_k$ the probability of matching exactly $k$ numbers. Since $p_k$ is highest for _low_ values of
$k$ (matching 2 numbers is easier than matching 6), our worst case (highest number of tickets in a
winning category) is $k = 2$. Assuming all tickets have 6 numbers for simplicity, the probability of
matching 2 numbers is:

$$
p_2 = \frac{
  {6 \choose 2} \cdot {{90 - 6} \choose {6 - 2}}
}{
  {90 \choose 6}
} = \frac{15 \cdot 1929501}{622614630} \approx 0.04648543995
$$

With

$$
n = 1000000
$$

$np_2$ yields approximately 46,485 winners. It is very hard to run any kind of algorithm on 46,485
elements on the EVM, and it is impossible if storage is involved in any way, as the gas cost would
exceed the limits. Not only this means we will not be able to implement a naive drawing algorithm
that scans all tickets and finds the winners by counting the matches of each one; even if somehow we
knew the list of winners for a category we would not be able to attribute or transfer their prizes.

### Ticket Indexing

The problem discussed above poses two fundamental requirements on our implementation:

1. Prize attribution must be based on a withdrawal model: the lottery smartcontract will not be able
   to send any money to the players; rather, the winning players will have to perform a transaction
   that withdraws the prize of a ticket (if any).
2. We will not be able to identify the winning tickets of a category, but we still need to know the
   _number_ of winning 6-combinations in that category in order to calculate the prize that can be
   withdrawn by each winner.

The number of winning 6-combinations described in point #2 must somehow be readily available in
storage. We cannot calculate it at drawing time by scanning all tickets, so this number must be
progressively calculated as tickets are sold. Since the 6 drawn numbers are not known while the
tickets are sold, we need to progressively calculate and update the number of winners _in all
622,614,630 possible cases_. As it turns out, this is actually feasible and does not inflate gas
costs to unacceptable levels. In the following sections we will describe the required algorithms and
analyze the resulting gas costs.

### Indexing Algorithm

Let us define a bijection from the first 90 positive naturals 1, 2, 3, ... to the first 90 primes 2,
3, 5, ...

We have:

$$
1 \leftrightarrow 2\newline
2 \leftrightarrow 3\newline
3 \leftrightarrow 5\newline
4 \leftrightarrow 7\newline
5 \leftrightarrow 11\newline
6 \leftrightarrow 13\newline
7 \leftrightarrow 17\newline
...\newline
88 \leftrightarrow 457\newline
89 \leftrightarrow 461\newline
90 \leftrightarrow 463
$$

The first 90 positive naturals correspond to the numbers that can be played and drawn in ExaLotto.

Let us call the above table $P$ so that $P_i$ is the $i$-th prime.

A ticket with 6 numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$, $a_5$, $a_6$, **independently of their order**,
can be identified by the following product:

$$
H = P_{a_1} \cdot P_{a_2} \cdot P_{a_3} \cdot P_{a_4} \cdot P_{a_5} \cdot P_{a_6}
$$

Storing these numbers is not a problem thanks to the 256-bit integers used by Solidity. For a
20-number ticket, which has a hefty base cost of $58,140 as per the [price table
above](#game-description), we have:

$$
20 \cdot log_2(463) \approx 177.097
$$

So the product for such a ticket will take less than 177 bits.

We can now index all tickets in a Solidity `mapping` whose keys are such products and whose values
are the number of 6-combinations containing those numbers. Then, at draw time, the number of
6-combinations with 6 matches is readily available in storage at the slot of the `mapping`
corresponding to:

$$
H_6 = P_{d_1} \cdot P_{d_2} \cdot P_{d_3} \cdot P_{d_4} \cdot P_{d_5} \cdot P_{d_6}
$$

with $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$, $d_4$, $d_5$, and $d_6$ being the 6 drawn numbers.

This provides an easy way to find out $H_6$ in O(1), but of course we need to repeat the process for
all other winning categories. It will get more expensive for other categories because there will be
many ways to choose 2 numbers out of the 6 drawn ones, many ways to choose 3 numbers, etc.

In total, the drawing algorithm will need to look up:

$$
\sum_{i = 2}^{6} {6 \choose i} = 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 57
$$

`mapping` slots, which is very manageable.

That is also the number of `mapping` slots that the ticket-buying algorithm will have to _write_ for
a 6-number ticket, which is somewhat more critical and becomes worse with higher order tickets.

Writing a non-zero value in a storage slot that is currently zero costs 20,000 gas units, as implied
by the [official specification][storage-gas-costs] (we are assuming cold access). Indexing a
6-number ticket whose numbers have never been played before in the current round therefore costs
$20000 \cdot 57 = 1140000$ gas units. With a pessimistic gas cost of 500 Gwei that makes for a
**0.57 MATIC gas fee**. Assuming 1 MATIC = 1 USD for simplicity, the 0.57 MATIC fee adds to a
~1.50 MATIC ticket value for a total of **2.07 MATIC for a 6-number ticket**, which we deem
acceptable.

Note that the gas cost greatly improves if two or more numbers have already been played in the
current round. In the best-case scenario where all 6 numbers have already been played, each of the
57 slots is updated from non-zero to non-zero and only costs 2900 gas units. That results in a fee
of 165,300 gas units or 0.08265 MATIC (under the same assumption of a 500 Gwei gas cost), leaving
the original \$1.50 price almost unaltered.
