## Abstract

We hereby provide the design specification of **ExaLotto**, a lottery game based on the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (“EVM” in the following).

The game will be managed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO” in the following).

## Motivations

Lottery games have ancient origins tracing back to the Chinese Han Dynasty, between years 205 and
187 BC. The core idea of the game is that every player pays a small amount of money and a randomly
chosen lucky winner gets the money from all contributions.

Unfortunately, classic operation of such games requires a central running authority and subjects
them to serious issues:

* **Censorship**: some countries make some or all lotteries illegal.
* **Locality**: lotteries are usually State-managed and subject to local regulations, making them
  impossible to extend across borders and turn global.
* **Obscure or unfair prize allocation**: in a typical lottery game a share of the jackpot is
  assigned to every winning category, but the way these shares are calculated is almost never
  explained and is often unfair.
* **Outright scams**: classic operation provides little to no guarantees about the fairness of the
  drawing process, as well as the actual value of the ticket sales. The drawn numbers may be biased
  to favor specific players, and / or the lottery operator may advertise a jackpot that is
  significantly lower (but still attractive enough) than the ticket sales. It is certainly
  suspicious that many lotteries constantly advertise perfectly round-numbered jackpots like $1M.

Case in point, [Hot Lotto][hot-lotto] suffered one of the most famous lottery fraud scandals (not
necessarily the worst). Other known frauds include a [Serbian lottery announcing the numbers before
they were drawn][serbian-lottery] and [Chinese lottery operators reportedly stealing jackpot
money][chinese-lottery]. Other frauds that might have occurred may never be uncovered.

We want to overcome all the above problems by implementing a new lottery game based on a
decentralized, trustless, censorship-resistant, and cryptographically verified platform: the EVM.

## Game Description

For scalability reasons the game will run on the [Polygon PoS blockchain][polygon], which is
compatible with Ethereum and can run Solidity programs with little to no modifications.

Players join the game by buying one or more tickets. When buying a ticket, a player chooses 6 or
more different numbers between 1 and 90 inclusive.

6 different random numbers in the same range are drawn once a week by the system, and all tickets
matching two or more of the drawn numbers are awarded a prize.

The jackpot money is managed by an Ethereum smartcontract at all times, and is kept in MATIC which
is the native currency of the Polygon PoS blockchain.

The ticket sales are also entirely managed by the smartcontract. A 6-number ticket has a small fixed
price that is the Ether equivalent of 1.50 US dollars, recalculated at the beginning of each round
based on the latest Ether market price.

## DAO Management and Referral Program

ExaLotto is a decentralized lottery game managed by a DAO. Voting power is proportional to an
[ERC20][erc20] token with trading symbol `EXL`.

## Prize allocation

As described in [DAO Management](#dao-management), 20% of the revenue from ticket sales is
distributed among partners; the remaining 80% is used to fund the prizes.

ExaLotto maintains 5 independent prizes for the 5 winning categories: one for the tickets with 2
matches, one for the tickets with 3 matches, etc. The prize for the tickets with 6 matches is also
known as the _jackpot_.

At round closure, immediately after the 6 winning numbers are drawn, the number of winners in each
category is calculated. If a given category has one or more winners the respective prize is spent,
meaning that it becomes available to the winners for withdrawal; otherwise the prize is carried over
to the next round.

In addition to the 5 prizes, ExaLotto keeps an extra stash that is used to fund the jackpot in case
one or more tickets match all 6 numbers; that way the jackpot is never zero.

The 80% value of the ticket sale revenue is allocated as follows: 18.8% is used for the prize of
each category and the remaining 6% is used for the stash.

All 5 winning categories are allocated the same fraction of the ticket sale revenue because we found
this to be the fairest possible allocation. In fact, in order to award the fairest possible prizes,
the share of a given category must be inversely proportional to the probability of winning and
directly proportional to the [expected][expectation] number of winners. In other words:

* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **higher** category because they have a
  **lower** probability of winning; and
* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **lower** category because we expect a
  **higher** number of winners.

So we have two conflicting criteria that balance each other out, as we show formally in the
following.

For a given category $k$ we can call the probability of winning in that category $p_k$, and the
expected number of winners $\xi_k$. We can use $n$ to indicate the total number of played
6-combinations in a round. $\xi_k$ is a [binomial variable][binomial-variable], so its expected
value is $np_k$. Based on the two proportionality criteria above, the share of the revenue allocated
to the prize for category $k$ can be measured as:

$$
S_k = \frac{E(\xi_k)}{p_k} = \frac{np_k}{p_k} = n
$$

This measure does not depend on $p_k$ or any other $k$-dependent parameter, so **all shares must
have the same size**. This is unlike most other lotteries, which allocate seemingly arbitrary or
inadequately explained shares of the revenue to the various categories.

## Lottery Smartcontract

// TODO

```sol
contract Test {
  uint private _foo = 42;

  function test() public view returns (uint) {
    return _foo;
  }
}
```

// TODO

## Governance

The implementation of the `EXL` token extends OpenZeppelin's [`ERC20Votes`][erc20-votes].
