## Abstract

We hereby provide the design specification of **ExaLotto**, a lottery game based on the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (“EVM” in the following).

The game will be managed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO” in the following).

## Motivations

Lottery games have ancient origins tracing back to the Chinese Han Dynasty, between years 205 and
187 BC. The core idea of the game is that every player pays a small amount of money and a randomly
chosen lucky winner gets the money from all contributions.

Unfortunately, classic operation of such games requires a central running authority and subjects
them to serious issues:

* **Censorship**: some countries make some or all lotteries illegal.
* **Locality**: lotteries are usually State-managed and subject to local regulations, making them
  impossible to extend across borders and turn global.
* **Obscure or unfair prize allocation**: in a typical lottery game a share of the jackpot is
  assigned to every winning category, but the way these shares are calculated is almost never
  explained and is often unfair.
* **Outright scams**: classic operation provides little to no guarantees about the fairness of the
  drawing process, as well as the actual value of the ticket sales. The drawn numbers may be biased
  to favor specific players, and / or the lottery operator may advertise a jackpot that is
  significantly lower (but still attractive enough) than the ticket sales. It is certainly
  suspicious that many lotteries constantly advertise perfectly round-numbered jackpots like $1M.

Case in point, [Hot Lotto][hot-lotto] suffered one of the most famous lottery fraud scandals (not
necessarily the worst). Other known frauds include a [Serbian lottery announcing the numbers before
they were drawn][serbian-lottery] and [Chinese lottery operators reportedly stealing jackpot
money][chinese-lottery]. Other frauds that might have occurred may never be uncovered.

We want to overcome all the above problems by implementing a new lottery game based on a
decentralized, trustless, censorship-resistant, and cryptographically verified platform: the EVM.

## Game Description

For scalability reasons the game will run on the [Polygon PoS blockchain][polygon], which is
compatible with Ethereum and can run Solidity programs with little to no modifications.

Players join the game by buying one or more tickets. When buying a ticket a player chooses 6 or more
different numbers between 1 and 90 inclusive.

6 different random numbers between 1 and 90 inclusive are drawn once a week by the system, and all
tickets matching two or more of the drawn numbers are awarded a prize.

The prize money is managed by an Ethereum smartcontract at all times, and is kept in MATIC which is
the native currency of the Polygon PoS blockchain.

The ticket sales are also entirely managed by the smartcontract. A 6-number ticket has a small fixed
price that is the MATIC equivalent of 1.50 US dollars, recalculated at the beginning of each round
based on the latest MATIC market price. We use [ChainLink's price feeds][chainlink-price-feed] to
get the latest market price.

Tickets with more than 6 numbers, which we call _higher order tickets_ throughout this paper, are in
every possible regard treated as if the player bought all possible 6-combinations that can be chosen
from the numbers. For example, a ticket with 8 numbers is equivalent to ${8 \choose 6} = 28$
different 6-number tickets, and in general a ticket with $k$ numbers (with $k \ge 6$) is equivalent
to ${k \choose 6}$ different 6-number tickets, with ${k \choose 6}$ being the [binomial
coefficient][binomial-coefficient] _"k choose 6"_, representing the number of ways to choose 6
elements from a set of $k$.

The binomial coefficient formula is used to calculate the price of a ticket with $k$ numbers given
that the price of a 6-number ticket is $1.50. The following prices result:

| Numbers in the ticket | Number of 6-combinations | Target price |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| 6                     | 1                        | $ 1.50       |
| 7                     | 7                        | $ 10.50      |
| 8                     | 28                       | $ 42.00      |
| 9                     | 84                       | $ 126.00     |

| 11                    | 462                      | $ 693.00     |

| 15                    | 5005                     | $ 7,507.50   |
| 16                    | 8008                     | $ 12,012.00  |
| 17                    | 12376                    | $ 18,564.00  |
| 18                    | 18564                    | $ 27,846.00  |
| 19                    | 27132                    | $ 40,698.00  |
| 20                    | 38760                    | $ 58,140.00  |

Five different winning categories are defined:

* tickets matching exactly 2 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 3 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 4 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 5 of the drawn numbers,
* and tickets matching all 6 drawn numbers.

ExaLotto keeps a separate prize for each category. The five prizes are funded by the revenue
generated by the ticket sales as explained in [Prize Allocation](#prize-allocation).

## DAO Management and Referral Program

ExaLotto is a decentralized lottery game managed by a DAO. Voting power is proportional to an
[ERC20][erc20] token with trading symbol `EXL`.

// TODO

## Prize Allocation

As described in [DAO Management](#dao-management-and-referral-program), 20% of the revenue from
ticket sales is distributed among partners; the remaining 80% is used to fund the prizes.

ExaLotto maintains 5 independent prizes for the 5 winning categories: one for the tickets with 2
matches, one for the tickets with 3 matches, etc. The prize for the tickets with 6 matches is also
known as the _jackpot_.

At round closure, immediately after the 6 winning numbers are drawn, the number of winners in each
category is calculated. If a given category has one or more winners the respective prize is spent,
meaning that it becomes available to the winners for withdrawal; otherwise the prize is carried over
to the next round.

In addition to the 5 prizes, ExaLotto keeps an extra stash that is used to fund the jackpot in case
one or more tickets match all 6 numbers; that way the jackpot is never zero.

The 80% value of the ticket sale revenue is allocated as follows: 18.8% is used for the prize of
each category and the remaining 6% is used for the stash.

All 5 winning categories are allocated the same fraction of the ticket sale revenue because we found
this to be the fairest possible allocation. In fact, in order to award the fairest possible prizes,
the share of a given category must be inversely proportional to the probability of winning and
directly proportional to the [expected][expectation] number of winners. In other words:

* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **higher** category because they have a
  **lower** probability of winning; and
* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **lower** category because we expect a
  **higher** number of winners.

So we have two conflicting criteria that balance each other out, as we show formally in the
following.

For a given category $k$ we can call the probability of winning in that category $p_k$, and the
expected number of winners $\xi_k$. We can use $n$ to indicate the total number of played
6-combinations in a round. $\xi_k$ is a [binomial variable][binomial-variable], so its expected
value is $np_k$. Based on the two proportionality criteria above, the share of the revenue allocated
to the prize for category $k$ can be measured as:

$$
S_k = \frac{E(\xi_k)}{p_k} = \frac{np_k}{p_k} = n
$$

This measure does not depend on $p_k$ or any other $k$-dependent parameter, so **all shares must
have the same size**. This is unlike most other lotteries, which allocate seemingly arbitrary or
inadequately explained shares of the revenue to the various categories.

  uint private _foo = 42;

  function test() public view returns (uint) {
    return _foo;
