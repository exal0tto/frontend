## Abstract

We hereby provide the design specification of **ExaLotto**, a lottery game based on the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (“EVM” in the following).

The game will be managed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO” in the following).

## Motivations

Lottery games have ancient origins tracing back to the Chinese Han Dynasty, between years 205 and
187 BC. The core idea of the game is that every player pays a small amount of money and a randomly
chosen lucky winner gets the money from all contributions.

Unfortunately, classic operation of such games requires a central running authority and subjects
them to serious issues:

* **Censorship**: some countries make some or all lotteries illegal.
* **Locality**: lotteries are usually State-managed and subject to local regulations, making them
  impossible to extend across borders and turn global.
* **Obscure or unfair prize allocation**: in a typical lottery game a share of the jackpot is
  assigned to every winning category, but the way these shares are calculated is almost never
  explained and is often unfair.
* **Outright scams**: classic operation provides little to no guarantees about the fairness of the
  drawing process, as well as the actual value of the ticket sales. The drawn numbers may be biased
  to favor specific players, and / or the lottery operator may advertise a jackpot that is
  significantly lower (but still attractive enough) than the ticket sales. It is certainly
  suspicious that many lotteries constantly advertise perfectly round-numbered jackpots like $1M.

Case in point, [Hot Lotto][hot-lotto] suffered one of the most famous lottery fraud scandals (not
necessarily the worst). Other known frauds include a [Serbian lottery announcing the numbers before
they were drawn][serbian-lottery] and [Chinese lottery operators reportedly stealing jackpot
money][chinese-lottery]. Other frauds that might have occurred may never be uncovered.

We want to overcome all the above problems by implementing a new lottery game based on a
decentralized, trustless, censorship-resistant, and cryptographically verified platform: the EVM.

## Game Description

For scalability reasons the game will run on the [Polygon PoS blockchain][polygon], which is
compatible with Ethereum and can run Solidity programs with little to no modifications.

Players join the game by buying one or more tickets. When buying a ticket a player chooses 6 or more
different numbers between 1 and 90 inclusive.

6 different random numbers between 1 and 90 inclusive are drawn once a week by the system, and all
tickets matching two or more of the drawn numbers are awarded a prize.

The prize money is managed by an Ethereum smartcontract at all times, and is kept in MATIC which is
the native currency of the Polygon PoS blockchain.

The ticket sales are also entirely managed by the smartcontract. A 6-number ticket has a small fixed
price that is the MATIC equivalent of 1.50 US dollars, recalculated at the beginning of each round
based on the latest MATIC market price. We use [ChainLink's price feeds][chainlink-price-feed] to
get the latest market price.

Tickets with more than 6 numbers, which we call _higher order tickets_ throughout this paper, are in
every possible regard treated as if the player bought all possible 6-combinations that can be chosen
from the numbers. For example, a ticket with 8 numbers is equivalent to ${8 \choose 6} = 28$
different 6-number tickets, and in general a ticket with $k$ numbers (with $k \ge 6$) is equivalent
to ${k \choose 6}$ different 6-number tickets, with ${k \choose 6}$ being the [binomial
coefficient][binomial-coefficient] _"k choose 6"_ representing the number of ways to choose 6
elements from a set of $k$.

The binomial coefficient formula is used to calculate the price of a ticket with $k$ numbers given
that the price of a 6-number ticket is $1.50. The following prices result:

| Numbers in the ticket | Number of 6-combinations | Target price |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| 6                     | 1                        | $ 1.50       |

| 8                     | 28                       | $ 42.00      |
| 9                     | 84                       | $ 126.00     |

| 17                    | 12376                    | $ 18,564.00  |
| 18                    | 18564                    | $ 27,846.00  |
| 19                    | 27132                    | $ 40,698.00  |

Five different winning categories are defined:

* tickets matching exactly 2 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 3 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 4 of the drawn numbers,
* tickets matching exactly 5 of the drawn numbers,
* and tickets matching all 6 drawn numbers.

ExaLotto keeps a separate prize for each category. The five prizes are funded by the revenue
generated by the ticket sales as explained in [Prize Allocation](#prize-allocation).

## DAO Management and Referral Program

ExaLotto is a decentralized lottery game managed by a DAO. Voting power is proportional to an
[ERC20][erc20] token with trading symbol `EXL`.

// TODO

## Prize Allocation

As described in [DAO Management](#dao-management-and-referral-program), 20% of the revenue from
ticket sales is distributed among partners; the remaining 80% is used to fund the prizes.

ExaLotto maintains 5 independent prizes for the 5 winning categories: one for the tickets with 2
matches, one for the tickets with 3 matches, etc. The prize for the tickets with 6 matches is also
known as the _jackpot_.

At round closure, immediately after the 6 winning numbers are drawn, the number of winners in each
category is calculated. If a given category has one or more winners the respective prize is spent,
meaning that it becomes available to the winners for withdrawal; otherwise the prize is carried over
to the next round.

In addition to the 5 prizes, ExaLotto keeps an extra stash that is used to fund the jackpot in case
one or more tickets match all 6 numbers; that way the jackpot is never zero.

The 80% value of the ticket sale revenue is allocated as follows: 18.8% is used for the prize of
each category and the remaining 6% is used for the stash.

All 5 winning categories are allocated the same fraction of the ticket sale revenue because we found
this to be the fairest possible allocation. In fact, in order to award the fairest possible prizes,
the share of a given category must be inversely proportional to the probability of winning and
directly proportional to the [expected][expectation] number of winners. In other words:

* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **higher** category because they have a
  **lower** probability of winning; and
* it is fair to allocate a larger share for the winners of a **lower** category because we expect a
  **higher** number of winners.

So we have two conflicting criteria that balance each other out, as we show formally in the
following.

For a given category $k$ we can call the probability of winning in that category $p_k$, and the
expected number of winners $\xi_k$. We can use $n$ to indicate the total number of played
6-combinations in a round. $\xi_k$ is a [binomial variable][binomial-variable], so its expected
value is $np_k$. Based on the two proportionality criteria above, the share of the revenue allocated
to the prize for category $k$ can be measured as:

$$
S_k = \frac{E(\xi_k)}{p_k} = \frac{np_k}{p_k} = n
$$

This measure does not depend on $p_k$ or any other $k$-dependent parameter, so **all shares must
have the same size**. This is unlike most other lotteries, which allocate seemingly arbitrary or
inadequately explained shares of the revenue to the various categories.

## Lottery Algorithm

A lottery game is based on the core idea that a large number of players pay a small amount each, so
we need our implementation to scale to large numbers of tickets, e.g. 1 million per round or even
more.

The number of tickets matching $k$ of the drawn numbers is a [binomial variable][binomial-variable]
with [expected value][expectation] $np_k$, with $n$ being the number of tickets sold in a round and
$p_k$ the probability of matching exactly $k$ numbers. Since $p_k$ is highest for _low_ values of
$k$ (matching 2 numbers is easier than matching 6), our worst case (highest number of tickets in a
winning category) is $k = 2$. Assuming all tickets have 6 numbers for simplicity, the probability of
matching 2 numbers is:

$$
p_2 = \frac{
  {6 \choose 2} \cdot {{90 - 6} \choose {6 - 2}}
}{
  {90 \choose 6}
} = \frac{15 \cdot 1929501}{622614630} \approx 0.04648543995
$$

With

$$
n = 1000000
$$

$np_2$ yields approximately 46,485 winners. It is very hard to run any kind of algorithm on 46,485
elements on the EVM, and it is impossible if storage is involved in any way, as the gas cost would
exceed the limits. Not only this means we will not be able to implement a naive drawing algorithm
that scans all tickets and finds the winners by counting the matches of each one; even if somehow we
knew the list of winners for a category we would not be able to attribute or transfer their prizes.

This poses two fundamental requirements on our implementation:

1. Prize attribution must be based on a withdrawal model: the lottery smartcontract will not be able
   to send any money to the players; rather, the winning players will have to perform a transaction
   that withdraws the prize of a ticket (if any).
2. We will not be able to identify the winning tickets of a category, but we still need to know the
   _number_ of winning 6-combinations in that category in order to calculate the prize that can be
   withdrawn by each winner.

The number of winning 6-combinations described in point #2 must somehow be readily available in
storage. We cannot calculate it at drawing time by scanning all tickets, so this number must be
progressively calculated as tickets are sold. Since the 6 drawn numbers are not known while the
tickets are sold, we need to progressively calculate and update the number of winners _in all
622,614,630 possible cases_. As it turns out, this is actually feasible and does not inflate gas
costs to unacceptable levels. We hereby describe the required algorithm and analyze the resulting
gas costs.

Let us define a bijection from the first 90 positive naturals 1, 2, 3, ... to the first 90 primes 2,
3, 5, ...

We have:

$$
1 \leftrightarrow 2\newline
2 \leftrightarrow 3\newline
3 \leftrightarrow 5\newline
4 \leftrightarrow 7\newline
5 \leftrightarrow 11\newline
6 \leftrightarrow 13\newline
7 \leftrightarrow 17\newline
...\newline
88 \leftrightarrow 457\newline
89 \leftrightarrow 461\newline
90 \leftrightarrow 463
$$

The first 90 positive naturals correspond to the numbers that can be played and drawn in ExaLotto.

Let us call the above table $P$ so that $P_i$ is the $i$-th prime.

A ticket with 6 numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$, $a_5$, $a_6$, **independently of their order**,
can be identified by the following product:

$$
H = P_{a_1} \cdot P_{a_2} \cdot P_{a_3} \cdot P_{a_4} \cdot P_{a_5} \cdot P_{a_6}
$$

So we can index all tickets in a Solidity `mapping` whose keys are such products and whose values
are the number of 6-combinations containing those numbers.

Then, at draw time, the number of 6-combinations with 6 matches is readily available in storage at
the slot of the `mapping` corresponding to:

$$
H_6 = P_{d_1} \cdot P_{d_2} \cdot P_{d_3} \cdot P_{d_4} \cdot P_{d_5} \cdot P_{d_6}
$$

with $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$, $d_4$, $d_5$, and $d_6$ being the 6 drawn numbers.

This provides an easy way to find out $H_6$ in O(1), but of course we need to repeat the process for
all other winning categories. It will get more expensive for other categories because there will be
many ways to choose 2 numbers out of the 6 drawn ones, many ways to choose 3 numbers, etc.

In total, the drawing algorithm will need to look up:

$$
\sum_{i = 2}^{6} {6 \choose i} = 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 57
$$

`mapping` slots, which is very manageable.

That is also the number of `mapping` slots that the ticket-buying algorithm will have to _write_ for
a 6-number ticket, which is somewhat more critical and becomes worse with higher order tickets.

Writing a non-zero value in a storage slot that is currently zero costs 20,000 gas units, as implied
by the [official specification][storage-gas-costs] (we are assuming cold access). Indexing a
6-number ticket whose numbers have never been played before in the current round therefore costs
$20000 \cdot 57 = 1140000$ gas units. With a pessimistic gas cost of 500 Gwei that makes for a
**0.57 MATIC gas fee**. Assuming 1 MATIC = 1 USD for simplicity, the 0.57 MATIC fee adds to a
~1.50 MATIC ticket value for a total of **2.07 MATIC for a 6-number ticket**, which we deem
acceptable.

Note that the gas cost greatly improves if two or more numbers have already been played. In the
best-case scenario where all 6 numbers have already been played in the current round, each of the 57
slots is updated from non-zero to non-zero and only costs 2900 gas units. That results in a fee of
165,300 gas units or 0.08265 MATIC (under the same assumption of a 500 Gwei gas cost), leaving the
original $1.50 price almost unaltered.
